### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is Edward Rivera.

I am an aspiring data analyst with experience in revenue management. I have worked with SQL and Python in a work environment and am working on expanding my knowledge in JavaScript, VBA, and NoSQL. I hope to leverage these new skills into a data analyst position while continuing to learn with the goal of becoming a data scientist one day soon.
